IDE Plugins for AribaWeb
========================

This project defines a plug in for the Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA development
environments (IDEs).

FEATURES
--------
The plugin adds three features to IDEA and Eclipse:


#### Code to/from Template toggle  (Alt-A / Ctrl-Alt-A)

By convention, in AribaWeb the code (.java or .groovy) and template (.awl or .htm)
files sit together in the source directory and have the same name (but different file
extensions).  The Alt-A command will toggle from viewing the code to template, or
visa-versa.  You'd be surprised about just how handy this is in practice.


#### Tag to Definition Jump (Alt-B, Ctrl-Alt-B)

When viewing a .awl file, if your cursor sits in an AW tag (e.g. `<TextButton>`)
and you press Alt-B you will be jumped to the .awl file that defines that
tag.

Note: This feature is presently not working correctly for tags with namespace
prefixes (e.g. `<w:TextButton>`).  This will be remedied in a future release.


#### App to Source File Navigation

This one is pretty cool:  there are various contexts in which (when in development mode)
your running AW app may display file names from your source code in the web page
(e.g. in an exception backtrace, in Component Inspector, or in the SearchSource app).
In these cases, when then name is displayed as a hyperlink, clicking it will open
the file in your IDE (and navigate to the correct line number)!


#### Code completition for AWL files
We are now supporting code completion for AWL files. The only thing you need to do
is to build AW distribution so you have .XSD files under docs/* and once you set
AW_HOME all starts working.


#### Structured view for OSS files and highlighting
There is no more plain text files for oss. but normal code like we are used to for other
supported types.

INSTALLING
----------

To use the plug in within your IDE you must first install the appropriate .jar file in
your IDE's plug in directory.  These plugins can be found in your AribaWeb install root:

    ide/
        ariba.ideplugin.eclipse.5.0b6.jar
        aribawebIdeaPlugin.jar

Copy the appropriate one for your IDE into its plugins directory (e.g. eclipse/plugins)
and restart your IDE.

**IDEA:** The IDEA plug-in can be downloaded via the IntelliJ Preferences->Plugins -> Available
panel (search for AribaWeb).

GETTING STARTED: IDEA
---------------------
See the webcast, [AribaWeb: Setting up IntelliJ IDEA for AW Development](http://www.vimeo.com/1776187).

Important:

- The first time you open a new AW project in IDEA you will be propted to enter your "AW_HOME"
  path variable.  After setting this variable to point at the install location for AribaWeb,
  *restart IDEA* (there appears to be a bug where this parameter change does not properly
  take effect until after a clear restart)

- *You need to update your Ant Home to Ant 1.7.1*.  IDEA 7.0.x comes bundled with Ant
   1.7.0.  AW build files require 1.7.1, so you need to update your Ant_Home to 1.7.1.
   In the Ant panel Properties panel, under the "Execution" panel, select "Use custom ant",
   click the "..." file selector button, and select the copy of Ant 1.7.1 bundled in
   AW_HOME/tools/ant.

GETTING STARTED: ECLIPSE
------------------------
The plugin automatically aids in the setup of your Eclipse workspace for AW development.

- Upon the first restart after installing the plugin, Eclipse will prompt you for your
  AW_HOME.  Select the directory where you unzipped the AribaWeb distribution.

- Based on your AW_HOME, the plug in will:
    1. Change your Ant Home to point at the 1.7.1 version included with AribaWeb
    2. Set the Ant variable ${aw.home} to point at your AW_HOME
    3. Set up a "User Library" with all of the AW distribution jars (for use
           in the classpath of your AW projects).

BUILDING
--------

To rebuild the plugin from source, you will need to point the Ant build at the location
of your IDE's lib directory containing the integration jars.

For IDEA, look for a directory that includes the following:

 - openapi.jar
 - extensions.jar

(these can likely be found inside IDEA's application directory).

Invoke the ant build as follows:

        ant -Didea.lib.dir=/Applications/IntelliJIdea.app/lib

(Assuming that your IDEA is installed in /Applications/IntelliJIdea.app).

For Eclipse, look for a directory that includes something like the following:

 - org.eclipse.core.commands_3.2.0.I20060605-1400.jar
 - org.eclipse.core.jobs_3.2.0.v20060603.jar
 - org.eclipse.core.resources_3.2.1.R32x_v20060914.jar
 - org.eclipse.core.runtime_3.2.0.v20060603.jar
 - org.eclipse.equinox.common_3.2.0.v20060603.jar
 - org.eclipse.equinox.registry_3.2.1.R32x_v20060814.jar
 - org.eclipse.jface_3.2.1.M20060908-1000.jar
 - org.eclipse.osgi_3.2.1.R32x_v20060919.jar
 - org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_3.2.1.v3235.jar
 - org.eclipse.text_3.2.0.v20060605-1400.jar
 - org.eclipse.ui.ide_3.2.1.M20060915-1030.jar
 - org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor_3.2.0.v20060605-1400.jar
 - org.eclipse.ui.workbench_3.2.1.M20060906-0800.jar

Invoke your ant build as follows:

    ant -eclipse.lib.dir=/Applications/eclipse/plugins
